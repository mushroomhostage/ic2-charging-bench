Permission to Port, Package, and Plagiarize

* Porting - You may freely port this mod to any platform that I don't make releases for (e.g. Bukkit). If I'm unusually busy and don't update it fast enough after a new IC2 release, you may (if you're so inclined) make an unofficial port of the mod to the new version of IC2 and link it in this thread.

* Mod Packs - You may include this mod in any server-specific mod pack, or in any public mod pack which has permission to include IC2.

* Reuse and Derivative Works - You may decompile this mod and use parts of its source code in your own work, except those parts which are borrowed from IC2's source code. (I think the provideEnergy method is the only thing left that contains any real copy-pasted material.) If you use any significant amount of material from this mod in your own, I would appreciate being credited and notified about the mod. (Mostly just because I'd be curious to see what you made out of it.)
